While some landslides fail catastrophically, others exhibit slow seasonal slip, often amounting to only centimeters to meters per year. What determines which of these two differing modes of behavior dominates remains a key problem in landslide mechanics and natural hazard prediction. We are investigating the physical processes that are thought to govern slow slip in landslides at Oak Ridge Earthflow (at left) near San Jose, CA.
