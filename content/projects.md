      title: Selected Projects
      text: >
        I have a wide interest in all phenomena relating to the initiation and movement of landslides.
        My current research mainly focuses on:
        
        1. Initiation and movement mechanisms of rapid long-travel landslides  
        2. Prediction of landsliding via geotechnical experiments  
        3. Generation and maintenance of excess pore-water pressure and landsliding  
        4. Formation of fluidized soil layer structures and landslide movement  
        5. Risk assessment of large-scale reactivated landslides  
        6. Instability of landslide dams and hazard mitigation  
        7. Landslides occurring under extreme weather  
        8. Shear behavior of landslide clay and fault gouge  
        
        The research approaches include:  
        - Laboratory tests (ring shear tests and flume tests)  
        - Field investigations (landslide monitoring, Surface-Wave surveys, tremor and seismic monitoring)  
        - Theoretical analysis (continuum mechanics, granular material mechanics)
