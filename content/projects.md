      title: Selected Projects
      text: I have a wide interest in all phenomena relating to the initiation and movement of landslides. Recently, I am mainly performing my research on the topics of (1) Initiation and movement mechanisms of rapid long travel landslides; (2)Prediction of landsliding by means of geotechnical experiments; (3) Initiation and maintenance of excess pore-water pressure and landsliding; (4) Formation of fluidized soil layer structures and landslide movement; (5) Risk assessment of large-scale reactivated landslides; (6) Instability of landslide dams and hazard mitigation; (7) landslides occurring under extreme weather; and (8) Shear behavior of landslide clay and fault gouge, by the approaches of (a) laboratory tests (ring shear tests and flume tests); (b) field investigation (landslide monitoring, Surface-Wave-Technique based survey, Tremor monitoring, seismic monitoring on slopes) and (c) theoretical analysis (continuum mechanics, and granular material mechanics).
