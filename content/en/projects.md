        I have a wide interest in all phenomena relating to the initiation and movement of landslides.
        My current research mainly focuses on:
        
        + Initiation and movement mechanisms of rapid long-travel landslides  

        + Prediction of landsliding via geotechnical experiments  

        + Generation and maintenance of excess pore-water pressure and landsliding 

        + Formation of fluidized soil layer structures and landslide movement  

        + Risk assessment of large-scale reactivated landslides  

        + Landslides occurring under extreme weather  

        + Shear behavior of landslide clay and fault gouge  
        
        The research approaches include: 
         
        + Laboratory tests (ring shear tests and flume tests) 

        + Field investigations (landslide monitoring, Surface-Wave surveys, tremor and seismic monitoring)  

        + Theoretical analysis (continuum mechanics, granular material mechanics)
